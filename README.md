# NeuralNetwork
Artificial Neural Network implemented in Python using Numpy. Inspired by 3Blue1Brown's series on the topic: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi

Running Instructions: after installing the needed packages using PIP, run "main.py" to kickstart the program. A new window will open where you will be able to select the image you wish to run throught the network.
If you already have a built model saved to the "model" directory, the program will immediately load it and run your picture through the program. If you don't, the program will train a new network for you. The model that is already submitted has an accuracy rate of 93% after 10 min of training.
